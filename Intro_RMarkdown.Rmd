# Introduction to R Markdown

This is a short tutorial to introduce R Markdown for someone who has experience in R and zero-experience in Markdown, and will discuss the basic Markdown syntax and essential features in R Markdown. Fore more details and systematic learning purpose, I recommend you read this book to know everything about R Markdown: [R Markdown: The Definite Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. It is easy to format headings, bold text, italics, etc. There is a quick reference guide as shown in Figure 1 and links to the [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (a Markdown cheatsheet is included) can be found in the Help drop-down menu. 

Markdown file (with a suffix `.md`) can be created and written in many text editors, ex., [Notedpad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Windows Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad), and [Terminal Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal#:~:text=Windows%20Terminal%20is%20a%20command,connect%20to%20Azure%20Cloud%20Shell.). In short, Markdown files can be seamlessly opened and organized in almost any editors. In this tutorial, we are going to create and edit a Markdown file in RStudio.

Let's walk through the basic Markdown syntax together and try to create a course Syllabus in Markdown. Here are some of the hints: 

- Emphasis: `*` or `**`
- Headers: `#`, `##`, and `###`
- Lists: 
  - Unordered list: `*`, `-`, `+`, etc..
  - Ordered list: `1`, `2`, etc..
- Manual Line Breaks: end a line with two or more spaces
- Links: `[My personal website](https://yuxiaoluo.github.io)`
- Images: `![alt text](figures/img.png)`
- Horizontal Rule/Page Break: `******`

## What is R Markdown?
R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science and can be used to:

- save and execute code

- generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats. This [1-minute video](https://vimeo.com/178485416) should help you better understand its use. 

### How to get started with R Markdown?

R Markdown is free and open source and is integrated in the resourceful R library, [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Use the command to install the `rmarkdown` package in R. 

```{r install rmarkdown, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
library(rmarkdown)
```

Then, you can navigate to the Menu bar and open a new R markdown file following `File` --> `New File` --> `R Markdown...`. 

### Output the R Markdown file

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. R Markdown generates a new file that contains selected text, code, and results from the `.Rmd` file. The new file can be a finished web page, PDF, MS Word document, slide show, notebook, handout, book, dashboard, package vignette or other format. When you run `render`, R Markdown feeds the `.Rmd` file to `knitr`, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output. R Markdown can be rendered to different formats and to more than one type of documents a the same time by specifying one or more formats in the output argument. 

#### Output formats

You can either use the RStudio IDE `Knit` button on the top bar of the `.Rmd` script window to render your `.Rmd` file to other format, or write the`render` function in the RStudio console to do the same thing. 

Set the `output_format` argument of `render` to render your `.Rmd` file into any of R Markdown’s supported formats. For example, the code below renders 1-example.Rmd to a Microsoft Word document. 

```{r output format, eval = FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
render("1-example.Rmd", output_format = "word_document")
```

If you do not select a format, R Markdown renders the file to its default format, which you can set in the output field of a `.Rmd` file’s header. The header of a raw R Markdown script shows that it renders to an HTML file by default. The list below shows the variable formats to output with R Markdown.  

* html_notebook - Interactive R Notebooks

* html_document - HTML document w/ Bootstrap CSS

* pdf_document - PDF document (via LaTeX template)

* word_document - Microsoft Word document (docx)

* odt_document - OpenDocument Text document

* rtf_document - Rich Text Format document

* md_document - Markdown document (various flavor

Please also be aware of that this short list doesn't include all the possible formats and you have other options, ex., github_document, which s GitHub Flavored Markdown document. You can also build books, websites, and interactive documents with R Markdown. For more details, you can check out the [this lesson](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html).

### R Code Chunks

In R Markdown, you edit the R code in a code chunk. `Ctrl+Alt+i` is the shortcut for creating R code chunk. You can also create code chunks executing other programming languages like Python, Bash, SQL, etc.  

#### Embeding R code

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, inlcude = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

It's important to remember when you are creating an RMarkdown file that if you want to run code that refers to an object, for example: 

```{r ex1, eval = FALSE}
print(dataframe)
```

you should include instructions showing what is the `dataframe`, just like a normal step in R script. For example: 

```{r ex2}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 9, 85, 23)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
print(dataframe)
```

If you are loading a dataframe from a `.csv` file, you must include the code in the `.Rmd`

```{r ex3, eval = FALSE}
dataframe <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Code/dataframe.csv")

```

#### Including plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. 

#### Inserting figures
Inserting a graph into RMarkdown is easy, the more energy-demanding aspect might be adjusting the formatting.

By default, RMarkdown will place graphs by maximizing their height, while keeping them within the margins of the page and maintaining aspect ratio. If you have a particularly tall figure, this can mean a really huge graph. In the following example we modify the dimensions of the figure we created above. To manually set the figure dimensions, you can insert an instruction into the curly braces:

```{r insert figure, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
print(dataframe)
boxplot(B~A,data=dataframe)
```

#### Inserting tables

While R Markdown can print the contents of a dataframe easily by enclosing the name of the data frame in code chunk. 

Another pleasing way for simple table formatting is `kable()` in the `knitr` package. The first argument tells kable to make a table out of the object `dataframe` and that numbers hould have to significant figures. 

```{r insert table}
library(knitr)
kable(dataframe, digits = 2)
```

If you want to control the content in your table, you can use `pander()` in the package `pander`. Remember to load the package in code chunk as well. The code below I want the 3rd column to appear in italics: 

```{r pander, warning=FALSE}
library(pander)
plant <- c("a", "b", "c")
temperature <- c(20, 20, 20)
growth <- c(0.65, 0.95, 0.15)
dataframe <- data.frame(plant, temperature, growth)
emphasize.italics.cols(3)   # Make the 3rd column italics
pander(dataframe)           # Create the table
```

Alternatively, you may also create tables using Markdown syntax. 

#### Creating tables from model outputs

Using `tidy()` from the package `broom`, we are able to create tables of our model outputs, and insert these tables into our markdown file. The example below shows a simple example linear model, where the summary output table can be saved as a new R object and then added into the markdown file.

```{r broom, warning = FALSE}
library(broom)
library(pander)
A <- c(20, 15, 10)
B <- c(1, 2, 3)

lm_test <- lm(A ~ B)          # Creating linear model

table_obj <- tidy(lm_test)    # Using tidy() to create a new R object called table

pander(table_obj, digits = 3) # Using pander() to view the created table, with 3 sig figs 
```

#### Chunk options

R Markdown is using `knitr` to generate the `.md` file. There are more than 50 chunk options that can be used to fine-tune the behavior of *knitr* when processing R chunks. Please refer to the online documentation [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) for the full list of options. 

You can apply the chunk options to individual code chunks; You can also apply any chunk options globally to a whole document, so you don't have to repeat the options in every single code chunk. To set chunk options globally, call `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` in a code chunk (usually the first one in the document), like the first code chunk in this R Markdown document. 

```{r global option, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6
)
```

- `eval`: (`TRUE`; logical or numeric) Whether to evaluate the code chunk. It can also be a numeric vector to choose which R expression(s) to evaluate, e.g., `eval = c(1, 3, 4)` will evaluate the first, third, and fourth expressions, and `eval = -(4:5)` will evaluate all expressions except the fourth and fifth.

- `echo`: (`TRUE`; logical or numeric) Whether to display the source code in the output document. Besides TRUE/FALSE, which shows/hides the source code, we can also use a numeric vector to choose which R expression(s) to echo in a chunk, e.g., echo = 2:3 means to echo only the 2nd and 3rd expressions, and echo = -4 means to exclude the 4th expression.

- `warning`: (`TRUE`; logical) Whether to preserve warnings (produced by warning()) in the output. If FALSE, all warnings will be printed in the console instead of the output document. It can also take numeric values as indices to select a subset of warnings to include in the output. Note that these values reference the indices of the warnings themselves (e.g., 3 means “the third warning thrown from this chunk”) and not the indices of which expressions are allowed to emit warnings.

- `include`: (`TRUE`; logical) Whether to include the chunk output in the output document. If FALSE, nothing will be written into the output document, but the code is still evaluated and plot files are generated if there are any plots in the chunk, so you can manually insert figures later.
